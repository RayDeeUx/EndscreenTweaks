# EndscreenTweaks

Various tweaks to the endscreen. (Formerly WholesomeEndTexts.)

Features:
* Showing attempt and jump counts in platformer levels.
* Auto-hiding the endscreen on level completion (unfortunately, the gray background still persists.)
* Hiding the chains or background from the endscreen
* Enabling the bouncing transition, even if "Fast Menu" from ingame is disabled.
* Changing the font of the "Level Complete" text message.
* Various checks to ensure compatibility with other mods that modify the endscreen
* Replaces "Level Complete" texts with wholesome ones, including those of your own choice.

Quotes originated from a variety of sources, including various members of the Geode SDK Discord server, variations of comments from level ID 64760396 that didn't make it to update 2.2, Ted Lasso on Apple TV+, Technoblade, and the writers throughout SNL's history.
