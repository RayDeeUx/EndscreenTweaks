# EndscreenTweaks
<c-AAAAAA>(Formerly WholesomeEndTexts.)</c>\
Spices things up a bit to the level endscreen.

## Features:
* Showing attempt and jump counts in platformer levels.
* Auto-hiding the endscreen on level completion (unfortunately, the gray background still persists.)
* Hiding the chains or background from the endscreen
* Enabling the bouncing transition, even if "Fast Menu" from ingame is disabled.
* Changing the font of the "Level Complete" text message.
* Various checks to ensure compatibility with other mods that modify the endscreen
* Replaces "Level Complete" texts with wholesome ones, including those of your own choice.

## Notes
This mod supersedes past copies of both Relative's Custom Endscreen Text mod and my WholesomeEndTexts mod from the old index.
